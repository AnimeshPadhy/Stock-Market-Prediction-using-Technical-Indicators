# Stock Market Prediction

This repository contains the materials for our end semester project on stock market prediction usingTechnical Indicators and ARIMA and LSTM models. The project focuses on predicting stock prices for NSEI and SENSEX datasets.


## Project Components

### Data Preprocessing
- Loading and cleaning the data
- Handling missing values
- Handling outliers
- Handling warm-up periods

### Effective EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Visualizing the stock prices and volume
- Identifying trends and patterns in the data
- Correlation analysis between features

### Feature Engineering
- Creation of technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD)
- Time-based features (e.g., day of the week, month)
- Lag features to capture temporal dependencies

### Feature Selection
- Backward feature elimination to select the most relevant features

### Modeling
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
  - Time series analysis and forecasting
  - Model fitting and evaluation
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
  - Deep learning approach for sequential data
  - Model architecture and training
  - Evaluation and comparison with ARIMA

## Results
- Detailed comparison of ARIMA and LSTM models
- Performance metrics and visualizations
- Insights and conclusions from the models' predictions
